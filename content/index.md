The third version of this site is much closer now to what [[Sylvia Nambiar|I]]'ve always had in mind in parts and morsels. Performing the functions of a personal site, a blog, a wiki (but one that only [[Sylvia Nambiar|I]] update), and a place to host [[Sylvia Nambiar|my]], this site is disjointed and fragmented, bursting at the seams, shifting and slipping.

[[Sylvia Nambiar|My]] [makeshift substack blog](https://translatingnp.substack.com) has been entirely absorbed and superseded here, either as [[Notes/index|notes]] or as [[Translations/index|translations]].

All [[Translations/index|translations]] from the previous site (as well as ones that were in progress when it went down) have been or will be republished after thorough revision.

Fret not if you see a page in your name; it's either a shaved down wiki entry or a stub to which mentions of your works and/or translations refer. Feel free to let [[Sylvia Nambiar|me]] know if you'd like me to make any changes (additions, removals, or modifications) to anything concerning you.

You may navigate the site with the sitemap or by following your own personal hyperlinked rabbit hole.

Several sections of the site either haven't been built yet or aren't fully updated; expect that to change with time. [[Sylvia Nambiar|I]]'m also working on improving the navigability.
