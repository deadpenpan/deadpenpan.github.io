>[!note] Sylvia's Note
>This is an _edited_ and _annotated_ transcript of the talk I delivered on the basis of a rough outline I provided to the interpreter (the exceptional Wenshuo Fan, who juggled translating between English, French, and Chinese) in advance. I forgot to share my screen with the supplementary slides I had prepared until I was well into my talk and the frequent pauses broke up any semblance of a flow; the edits are mainly to remedy the former, while the annotations are for the latter.
